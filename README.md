## About

*Burocrata* is a small command-line program that can check the existence of
copyright and license notices in source code files and add them when they are
missing.

## Installing

*Burocrata* is available from PyPI:

```
python -m pip install burocrata
```

and conda-forge:

```
conda install burocrata -c conda-forge
```

## Using

Check that very `.py` file in a directory has a license notice:

```
$ burocrata --check --extension=py source_folder
```

Removing the `--check` option will make Burocrata add the license notice to
the files that don't have them:

```
$ burocrata --extension=py source_folder
```

The license and copyright notice can be configured in a `pyproject.toml` file
located in the directory where `burocrata` is run:

```
$ cat pyproject.toml
[tool.burocrata]
notice = '''
# Copyright (c) YYYY Name of Developer.
# Distributed under the terms of the BSD 3-Clause License.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause'''
exclude = ["__init__.py"]
```

See a full list of options:

```
$ burocrata --help
```
